					<p class="subtitle-1 underlined">How to exercise your rights</p>
					<p class="desc-3">
						To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your verifiable request to us by contacting us via the details provided in this document.
						<br />
						For us to respond to your request, it’s necessary that we know who you are. Therefore, you can only exercise the above rights by making a verifiable request which must:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="desc-3">provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative;</li>
						<li class="desc-3">describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="desc-3">
						We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity and therefore confirm the personal information in our possession actually relates to you.
						<br />
						If you cannot personally submit a verifiable request, you can authorize a person registered with the California Secretary of State to act on your behalf.
						<br />
						If you are an adult, you can make a verifiable request on behalf of a minor under your parental authority.
						<br />
						You can submit a maximum number of 2 requests over a period of 12 months.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="list-item">
					<p class="subtitle-1 underlined">How and when we are expected to handle your request</p>
					<p class="desc-3">
						We will confirm receipt of your verifiable request within 10 days and provide information about how we will process your request.
						<br />
						We will respond to your request within 45 days of its receipt. Should we need more time, we will explain to you the reasons why, and how much more time we need. In this regard, please note that we may take up to 90 days to fulfill your request.
						<br />
						Our disclosure(s) will cover the preceding 12 month period.
						<br />
						Should we deny your request, we will explain you the reasons behind our denial.
						<br />
						We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. In such cases, we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act on the request. In either case, we will communicate our choices and explain the reasons behind it.
