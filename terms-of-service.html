<h4 class=title-h4>8. Additional Disclaimers and Acknowledgements</h4>
<p class=desc-3>
You hereby acknowledge and agree that we do not provide any custodial or similar services, custodial solutions or software, nor do we act as your agent or representative. We do not control, manage, or custody any of your Digital Assets.
<br><br>
We shall not be held responsible or liable for any operations carried out by you or any other person with the use of, or through, the Application, including the receipt, use, storage, or disposition of Digital Assets. We do not act as an intermediary or party to any transaction made through the Application and shall not be responsible for ensuring the completion or performance of any transaction made on the blockchain. We do not control or influence transactions involving Digital Assets and cannot cancel, reverse, block, or freeze any transactions conducted by you or any other user. You are responsible for ensuring that all your transactions comply with applicable laws and regulations.
<br><br>
Digital Assets are highly volatile, meaning their value, price and exchange rates may change dramatically in a short time due to various factors and forces. Certain Digital Assets may lose their value entirely. The composition of Digital Assets supplied to certain Third-Party Services, such as AMMs, may change, and their value may rise, fall, or drop significantly.
<br><br>
We do not facilitate or intermediate your interactions with the Protocol or Third-Party Services and shall not be responsible or held liable for any damages or losses you may incur as a result of changes in the composition, value, or price of your Digital Assets.
<br><br>
We are not your broker, fund manager, or any intermediary to any broker or fund manager. Nothing contained herein or on the Platform shall be considered as broker and/or fund management services, or any intermediation services related thereto.
<br><br>
No part of the information or content available on the Platform or otherwise communicated by us or on our behalf, or in the Documentation, should be considered to be business, legal, financial, investment, or tax advice, or advice of a broker regarding any matters to which all or any part of such information relates. You should consult your own legal, financial, tax, or other professional advisor regarding this information. We shall not be responsible for the accuracy of the information and materials contained on or provided through the Platform or Documentation, therefore any use of such information and materials is at your own discretion and risk, and you shall be solely responsible for any possible damages or losses arising from such use.
<br><br>
The terms ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù, ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù, ‚Äúdeposit‚Äù, and other similar terms, as may be used in the Application, on the Website, in the Documentation, as well as in other materials provided to you in connection with the Platform, are not meant to be interpreted literally. Rather, such terms are being used to draw rough, fuzzy-logic analogies between the heavily automated and mostly deterministic operations of decentralised smart-contracts and the discretionary performance of traditional off-chain transactions by people.
<br><br>
The Platform, including any information and materials available thereon, is not intended to constitute an offer of securities or Digital Assets or a solicitation for investment in, or purchase of securities or Digital Assets in any jurisdiction, nor is it intended to constitute a prospectus or offer document of any type. We do not provide any opinion or advice to purchase, sell, or otherwise transact with Digital Assets, and nothing communicated by us shall form the basis of, or be relied upon in connection with, any contract or investment decision. Please consult your own legal or financial advisor before making any decision and always conduct your own research.

<br><br>
Any Disputes arising out of or in connection with the Platform, these Terms, or any matters contemplated herein, including any question regarding the existence, validity, or termination of these Terms, shall be referred to and finally resolved by the binding arbitration under the London Court of International Arbitration rules, which are deemed to be incorporated by reference herein.

<br><br>
To the maximum extent permitted under the applicable law, you and we hereby waive the rights to a jury trial, class action arbitration, and to have any Dispute resolved in court.
<br><br>
